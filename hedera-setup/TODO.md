# Hedera Setup - Complete TODO List

**Project:** DeraLinks NFT RWA Platform - Hedera Blockchain Setup

**NFT Model:** Fractional ownership via Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collections
- Each property/asset = One NFT Collection (Hedera HTS Non-Fungible)
- Supply set at creation (e.g., 10,000 NFTs with serial numbers 1-10,000)
- Each NFT represents one share of the property
- Investors own specific NFT serial numbers
- Voting power = number of NFTs owned per property

**NFT Categories:** Real Estate, Agriculture, Properties

**AI/Analytics:** Automated valuation, continuous scoring, scenario analysis

**Network:** Hedera Testnet (Development) ‚Üí Mainnet (Production)

**Wallet Integration:** HashPack

**Keep it Simple**

## Important Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- **NEVER** commit `output/` directory to git (contains private keys!)
- **NEVER** commit `.env` file to git (contains operator credentials!)
- Store private keys in secure offline storage (hardware wallet, encrypted USB)
- Use separate accounts for development (testnet) and production (mainnet)
- Regularly backup all account information to multiple secure locations
- Implement key rotation every 90 days for security
- Monitor all platform accounts for unauthorized access
- Use hardware wallets for production mainnet accounts
- Enable 2FA on all Hedera portal accounts
- Keep operator account HBAR balance sufficient but not excessive
- Use multi-signature wallets for treasury account on mainnet
- Regular security audits for smart contracts
- Encrypt all backups with strong passwords

## Testnet ‚Üí Mainnet Migration Path

### What Stays the Same:
‚úÖ Your code
‚úÖ NFT metadata schemas
‚úÖ Smart contracts
‚úÖ Frontend UI/UX
‚úÖ HashPack integration code

### What Changes:
üîÑ Environment variable: `HEDERA_NETWORK=mainnet`
üîÑ Account IDs (new accounts on mainnet)
üîÑ NFT Collection IDs (new collections on mainnet)
üîÑ HCS Topic IDs (new topics on mainnet)
üîÑ Operator account (needs real HBAR)
üîÑ Transaction costs (real money on mainnet)

### Migration Process:
1. ‚úÖ Develop and test everything on TESTNET (Phases 1-11)
2. ‚úÖ Validate all functionality works perfectly
3. ‚úÖ Create mainnet operator account with real HBAR
4. ‚úÖ Run setup scripts on MAINNET (creates new resources)
5. ‚úÖ Update frontend config to use mainnet resource IDs
6. ‚úÖ Test on mainnet
7. ‚úÖ Launch to production users

**Remember:** Testnet and mainnet are completely separate networks. Resources created on testnet do NOT transfer to mainnet. You'll create fresh resources on mainnet when ready.
