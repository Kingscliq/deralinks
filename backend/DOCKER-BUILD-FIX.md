# Docker Build Fix - TypeScript Compilation Issue

## Problem

Docker build was failing during the TypeScript compilation stage with the error:

```
sh: tsc: not found
ERROR: process "/bin/sh -c npm run build" did not complete successfully: exit code 127
```

## Root Cause

The Dockerfile builder stage was installing only **production dependencies** using:
```dockerfile
RUN npm install --only=production
```

However, **TypeScript is a dev dependency** and is required to compile the TypeScript source code to JavaScript. Without TypeScript installed, the `npm run build` command (which executes `tsc`) would fail.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `package.json` Build Script

**File:** `backend/package.json:8`

**Before:**
```json
"build": "tsc"
```

**After:**
```json
"build": "npx tsc"
```

**Why:** Using `npx tsc` ensures that the TypeScript compiler is found in `node_modules/.bin` even if it's not in the global PATH.

### 2. Updated Dockerfile Builder Stage

**File:** `backend/Dockerfile:43-55`

**Before:**
```dockerfile
# Builder stage - compile TypeScript
FROM base AS builder
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies (use install for now, ci later when we have package-lock)
RUN npm install --only=production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build TypeScript
RUN npm run build
```

**After:**
```dockerfile
# Builder stage - compile TypeScript
FROM base AS builder
ENV NODE_ENV=production

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install ALL dependencies (including dev dependencies like TypeScript)
# This is needed to compile TypeScript to JavaScript
RUN npm install && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build TypeScript
RUN npm run build

# Now install only production dependencies for the final image
RUN npm prune --production
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Changed `npm install --only=production` to `npm install` to install **all dependencies** including dev dependencies
2. Added `npm prune --production` **after** the build to remove dev dependencies
3. This ensures TypeScript is available during build, but not included in the final production image

## Build Strategy

The multi-stage Dockerfile uses this strategy:

1. **Base Stage** - Install system dependencies (Python, Make, G++, PostgreSQL client)
2. **Builder Stage:**
   - Install ALL npm dependencies (including TypeScript)
   - Compile TypeScript to JavaScript (`dist/` directory)
   - Prune dev dependencies
3. **Production Stage:**
   - Copy only compiled JavaScript (`dist/`)
   - Copy production dependencies (`node_modules/`)
   - Run with minimal footprint

## Benefits

- ✅ TypeScript compilation works correctly
- ✅ Production image only contains compiled JavaScript
- ✅ Production image only has production dependencies
- ✅ Smaller final image size
- ✅ Faster startup time in production

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

```bash
# Build production image
cd /Users/user/Documents/deralinks/backend
docker build --target production --no-cache -t deralinks-backend:latest .

# Check for successful build
echo $?  # Should output 0

# Verify dist/ directory was created
docker run --rm deralinks-backend:latest ls -la /app/dist

# Verify TypeScript not in production image
docker run --rm deralinks-backend:latest npm list typescript
# Should show: (empty)
```

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - October 28, 2025

**Build Status:** Testing in progress

**Next Steps:**
1. Wait for Docker build to complete
2. Verify no TypeScript compilation errors
3. Test production image starts correctly
4. Ready for Render deployment
