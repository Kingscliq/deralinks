# Wallet Connection Setup - Final Steps

## ✅ What's Already Done

1. **Fixed linting errors** in wallet-related files
2. **Fixed header component** - removed undefined variables (`account`, `disconnect()`)
3. **Wallet integration** using `@buidlerlabs/hashgraph-react-wallets` is properly set up
4. **WalletProvider** is configured in `src/lib/wallet-provider.tsx`
5. **Fixed WalletConnect warning** - Suppressed "requiredNamespaces deprecated" warning
6. **WalletButton** component is fully functional with:
   - HashPack wallet support (recommended for Hedera)
   - MetaMask wallet support (EVM compatible)
   - Beautiful UI with dropdowns and connection states

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Up Your Reown (WalletConnect) Project ID

From your Reown Dashboard: https://dashboard.reown.com/5b756d45-d73a-489e-af3d-35ec6f378429/60df313a-33d2-4c02-b136-d8c4777a3dc2

**Step 1:** Copy your full Project ID from the dashboard (currently showing as `56..8c`)

**Step 2:** Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd /Users/user/deralinks/frontend
touch .env.local
```

**Step 3:** Add your Project ID to `.env.local`:

```env
# Reown/WalletConnect Project ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_full_project_id_here

# Hedera Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
```

**Step 4:** Update the project ID in `src/lib/wallet-provider.tsx` if needed (currently has a fallback)

### 2. Install Required Browser Extensions (For Testing)

**HashPack (Recommended):**

- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hashpack/gjagmgiddbbciopjhllkdnddhcglnemk
- Or visit: https://www.hashpack.app/

**MetaMask (Optional):**

- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn
- Or visit: https://metamask.io/

### 3. Test the Wallet Connection

```bash
# Start the development server
cd /Users/user/deralinks/frontend
yarn dev
```

Then:

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the header
3. Select either HashPack or MetaMask
4. Follow the wallet's prompts to connect
5. Your wallet address and balance should appear in the UI

## 🎨 UI Design System Note

You mentioned wanting a UI design system similar to the Reown Dashboard:

- Dark theme with clean layout
- Modern aesthetic
- Good use of gradients and spacing
- Professional dashboard look

This has been noted for later implementation. The current wallet UI already has:

- Gradient buttons
- Dark theme support
- Clean card-based layouts
- Smooth animations

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If wallet connection fails:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Ensure wallet extension is installed** and unlocked
3. **Verify Project ID** is correct in `.env.local`
4. **Check network** - Make sure you're on Hedera Testnet
5. **Clear cache** and restart the dev server

### Common Issues:

**"Project ID not found"**

- Solution: Add valid Project ID to `.env.local`

**"Wallet not detected"**

- Solution: Install HashPack or MetaMask browser extension

**"Connection rejected"**

- Solution: Check wallet extension, may need to unlock it
