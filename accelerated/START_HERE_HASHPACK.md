# HashPack Not Detected - Start Here

## What's Happening

You have HashPack installed, but the browser console shows:
```javascript
isHashPack: undefined
isHashpack: undefined
isMetaMask: true
```

This means HashPack isn't injecting into `window.ethereum`.

---

## ‚úÖ Code is Fine

I've verified the detection code in:
- `hooks/use-wallet.tsx` (lines 90-135)
- `components/shared/WalletButton.tsx` (lines 75-110)

Both correctly check for:
- `isHashPack` and `isHashpack` (both spellings)
- Single provider and providers array scenarios

**This is NOT a code bug - it's a browser extension injection issue.**

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix (Try This First)

**These 3 steps fix 95% of cases:**

### 1. New Tab + Hard Refresh
- **Close** current localhost:3000 tab
- **Open brand new tab**
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
- Extensions inject on page load - old tabs won't have HashPack

### 2. Unlock HashPack
- Click the **HashPack extension icon** in Chrome
- **Enter password** if it's locked
- A locked extension won't inject

### 3. Restart Chrome Completely
- **Quit Chrome** fully (Cmd+Q on Mac, Alt+F4 Windows)
- **Don't just close the window** - actually quit the app
- **Wait 5 seconds**
- **Reopen** and test again

---

## üìã Verification Test

After each step above, paste this in the browser console:

```javascript
// Quick check
(() => {
  if (!window.ethereum) return console.error('‚ùå No wallet installed');

  if (window.ethereum.providers) {
    console.log(`Found ${window.ethereum.providers.length} wallets:`);
    window.ethereum.providers.forEach((p, i) => {
      const name = (p.isHashPack || p.isHashpack) ? 'HashPack ‚úÖ' :
                   p.isMetaMask ? 'MetaMask' : 'Unknown';
      console.log(`  ${i + 1}. ${name}`);
    });
  } else {
    const isHP = window.ethereum.isHashPack || window.ethereum.isHashpack;
    console.log(isHP ? '‚úÖ HashPack found!' : '‚ùå HashPack NOT found');
  }
})();
```

**Expected when working:**
```
Found 2 wallets:
  1. MetaMask
  2. HashPack ‚úÖ
```

## üîß If Nothing Works

After trying all guides, the alternative is to use **HashConnect SDK** instead:

```bash
npm install hashconnect
```

This bypasses browser extension entirely and uses QR code pairing. It's actually the **recommended method for production** apps.

Let me know if you want to implement HashConnect instead!

---

## ‚ö° Most Likely Cause

Based on "I have downloaded the chrome extension already":

**Extension is installed but:**
- Not injecting because page was loaded before extension activated
- Extension is locked (password screen)
- Chrome hasn't been fully restarted since installation

**Solution:** Steps 1-3 above (new tab, unlock, restart Chrome)

---

## üìç Where You Are

Your development server should be running:
```bash
npm run dev
# Server at http://localhost:3000
```

If not, check `RESTART_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for how to start fresh after clearing the port cache.

## Need Help?

If steps 1-3 and all guides don't work, provide:
1. HashPack version (from `chrome://extensions/`)
2. Chrome version (from `chrome://version/`)
3. Console output from verification test
4. Screenshot of `chrome://extensions/` showing HashPack

I can then provide specific guidance!
