# DeraLinks - Real-World Asset Tokenization Platform

## Project Overview

DeraLinks is a comprehensive blockchain-based platform for tokenizing and fractionalizing real-world assets (RWAs) built on the Hedera Hashgraph network. The platform enables users to invest in high-value physical assets through NFT-backed fractional ownership, making previously illiquid and inaccessible investments available to retail investors.

## Core Concept

**Mission**: Democratize access to institutional-grade real-world assets through blockchain technology, allowing anyone to own fractions of premium assets starting from ₦10,000.

**Key Innovation**: Each fractional ownership is represented as a unique NFT on Hedera, providing immutable proof of ownership, transparent valuation, and instant tradability.
